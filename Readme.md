# Headstrong Website - reads Markdown files but ships HTML!
### Now using Python! (finally...)

So short statement, the Headstrong.Solutions website used to be C# based because I know C# and had already resolved a solution to do this, but building C# is a pain (especially on various platforms with various OS options like Raspberry Pi's etc).

Not a huge pain but when you're dealing with a site that is already so dynamic that if you change a source .md file it's automatically updateed the website for you, updating the websites engine itself suddenly feels clunky and annoying.

..also, yay python! :D
