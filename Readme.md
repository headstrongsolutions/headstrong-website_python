# Headstrong Website - reads Markdown files but ships HTML!
### Now using Python! (finally...)

So short statement, the Headstrong.Solutions website used to be C# based because I know C# and had already resolved a solution to do this, but building C# is a pain.
Not a huge pain, but when you're dealing with a site that is already so dynamic that if you change a source .md file it's automaticall yupdateed teh website for you, updating the websites engine itself suddenly feels clunky and annoying.
